# MiniIntruders
Space invaders clone
MiniIntruders is essentially a space invaders clone using the Phaser library.

When I was young, this was one of my first projects; you can see the original results on [a post of mine at TheGameCreators' forums](https://forum.thegamecreators.com/thread/135953). The DarkBASIC Pro source code for the original project is in the DBPro directory.

I have prototyped the project structure in hellophaser. Essentially:

* src - contains typescript files
 * typings - contains typing information; the contents are auto-generated by tsd
* wwwroot - contains files for deployment
To run, one must install node and bower dependencies, and "prepare" for deployment by copying lib dependencies to wwwroot. This can be accomplished by the following:

    npm install
    bower install
    grunt prepare
    
Now, anytime you want to develop, you simply have to use the run grunt task which will start a server, as well as run a compile-on-save typescript feature.

    grunt run
